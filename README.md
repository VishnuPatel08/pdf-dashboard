PDF Viewer + Data Extraction Dashboard
🎯 Objective

A monorepo project to build a PDF Review Dashboard where users can:

Upload and view PDFs in-browser.

Run AI extraction using Gemini API or Groq.

Edit extracted data, perform CRUD operations, and store data in MongoDB.

Maintain separation of frontend (apps/web) and backend (apps/api).

Follow best practices (linting, error handling, structured code).

🔧 Tech Stack

Monorepo: Turborepo or npm workspaces

Frontend (apps/web): Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + shadcn/ui

Backend (apps/api): Node.js (TypeScript, REST API)

Database: MongoDB Atlas

AI Integration: Gemini API or Groq

PDF Viewer: pdf.js

Deployment: Vercel (both frontend & backend)

🔹 Core Features

PDF Viewer

Upload local PDF (≤25 MB).

Render with zoom + page navigation.

Store in Vercel Blob or MongoDB GridFS.

AI Data Extraction

“Extract with AI” → choose Gemini or Groq.

Extract invoice fields:

Vendor (name, address, taxId)

Invoice (number, date, currency, subtotal, taxPercent, total, poNumber, poDate)

Line items (description, unitPrice, quantity, total)

Data Editing & CRUD

Edit extracted fields in UI.

Create/Read/Update/Delete invoice records in MongoDB.

List view with search (vendor.name, invoice.number).

API (apps/api)

POST /upload → accepts PDF → { fileId, fileName }

POST /extract → { fileId, model: "gemini" | "groq" } → extracted JSON

GET /invoices (+ ?q= search)

GET /invoices/:id

PUT /invoices/:id

DELETE /invoices/:id

Validations + consistent responses.

UI (apps/web)

Split layout: Left = PDF Viewer, Right = Editable Form.

Buttons: Extract, Save, Delete.

Built with shadcn/ui components (inputs, table, dialogs, toasts).

# Turborepo starter

This Turborepo starter is maintained by the Turborepo core team.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
npm install

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=docs
yarn exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```
